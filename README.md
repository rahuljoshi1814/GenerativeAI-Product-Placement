# 🛒 Generative AI Product Placement Tool
### **A Generative AI tool that places e-commerce product images into realistic backgrounds using SAM and OpenCV.**
This AI-powered tool takes standalone **product images** and seamlessly places them into **lifestyle backgrounds**, making them look like they naturally belong in the scene.

## 📌 Features
✅ **Batch Processing** – Handles multiple product images at once.  
✅ **AI-Powered Segmentation** – Uses **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** to extract product images.  
✅ **Realistic Placement** – Ensures correct **perspective, lighting, and transparency**.  
✅ **Preserves Product Details** – Keeps the original **quality, clarity, and shape**.  
✅ **Uses Only Free & Open-Source Models** – No paid APIs or tools required.  
✅ **Optimized for Lean Hardware** – Runs on standard machines without high-end GPUs.  

## 📂 **Project Directory Structure**

## 📥 **Installation & Setup**

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GenerativeAI-ProductPlacement.git
cd GenerativeAI-ProductPlacement

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
- pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3️⃣ Download the Required AI Model
- The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is required for segmentation.
- Follow the instructions in models/README.md to download and place the model.

### 4️⃣ Download & Place the Dataset
- Download product images from the provided link.
- Follow the instructions in inputs/products/README.md.

## Running the Project
Once everything is set up, run: python main.py
✅ This will process all product images and save the final results in outputs/.

📂 Dataset Information
📌 Product Images: Download from inputs/products/README.md.
📌 Background Images: Stored in inputs/backgrounds/.
📌 AI Model Checkpoints: Download instructions in models/README.md.

🛠 Technologies Used
Python 
OpenCV 
Segment Anything Model (SAM) 
NumPy 
TQDM (Progress Bar)

🔥 Possible Improvements
This project is functional, but there are several ways to enhance it further:

✅ Better Depth Matching – Use depth estimation models to match product depth with the background for even more realistic placement.
✅ Advanced Lighting Adjustments – Implement neural relighting to adjust product lighting according to background conditions.
✅ User-Specified Positioning – Allow users to manually adjust the placement of products inside backgrounds.
✅ More AI-Based Enhancements – Integrate Stable Diffusion Inpainting to refine product blending using generative AI.
