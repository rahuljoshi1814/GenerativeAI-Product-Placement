# Generative AI Product Placement Tool
### A Generative AI tool that places e-commerce product images into realistic backgrounds using SAM and OpenCV.

This AI-powered tool takes standalone  product images and seamlessly places them into ifestyle backgrounds, making them look like they naturally belong in the scene.

## Features
- **Batch Processing** â€“ Handles multiple product images at once.
- **AI-Powered Segmentation** â€“ Uses **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** to extract product images.
- **Realistic Placement** â€“ Ensures correct **perspective, lighting, and transparency**.
- **Preserves Product Details** â€“ Keeps the original **quality, clarity, and shape**.
- **Uses Only Free & Open-Source Models** â€“ No paid APIs or tools required.
- **Optimized for Lean Hardware** â€“ Runs on standard machines without high-end GPUs.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

- git clone https://github.com/rahuljoshi1814/GenerativeAI-Product-Placement.git
- cd GenerativeAI-Product-Placement

### 2. Install Dependencies

- pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Download the Required AI Model

- The **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** is required for segmentation.
- Follow the instructions in **models/README.md** to download and place the model.

### 4. Download & Place the Dataset

- Download product images from the provided link.
- Follow the instructions in **inputs/products/README.md**.

## Running the Project
- Once everything is set up, run: **python main.py**
- This will process all product images and save the final results in **outputs/**.

## Dataset Information
- **Product Images**: Download from **inputs/products/README.md**.
- **Background Images**: Stored in **inputs/backgrounds/**.
- **AI Model Checkpoints**: Download instructions in **models/README.md**.

## Explanation of Each Folder & File
### Folder/File	Purpose
- **main.py**	- Runs the full pipeline (segmentation â†’ blending â†’ saving results)
- **requirements.txt** - Contains the required Python libraries to install
- **README.md**	- The main project documentation (GitHub)
- **utils/**	- Contains helper functions for processing images
- **utils/get_all_images.py**	- Fetches images recursively from inputs/ folders
- **utils/segmentation.py**	- Extracts product from background using SAM
- **utils/blending.py	Places** - product into background with realistic blending
- **utils/batch_processing.py**	- Handles batch processing of multiple product images
- **models/	Stores the AI models** - required for segmentation
- **models/README.md** - Instructions to download & place the SAM model checkpoint
- **inputs/**	- Stores all input images (products & backgrounds)
- **inputs/products/** - Stores e-commerce product images (organized in subfolders)
- **inputs/products/README.md**	- Instructions to download & organize the product dataset
- **inputs/backgrounds/**	- Stores lifestyle background images
- **inputs/backgrounds/README.md**	- (Optional) Instructions for adding custom backgrounds
- **outputs/**	- Stores final processed images

## Technical Details
#### How It Works
- **1. Segmentation**: Uses Segment Anything Model (SAM) to extract product from its background.
- **2. Blending** : Applies alpha transparency, shadow effects, and scaling for natural placement.
- **3.Batch Processing**: Handles multiple images at once to generate realistic outputs quickly.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Segment Anything Model (SAM)
- NumPy
- TQDM (Progress Bar)

## Possible Improvements
This project is functional, but there are several ways to enhance it further:

- **Better Depth Matching** â€“ Use depth estimation models to match product depth with the background for even more realistic placement.
- **Advanced Lighting Adjustments** â€“ Implement neural relighting to adjust product lighting according to background conditions.
- **User-Specified Positioning** â€“ Allow users to manually adjust the placement of products inside backgrounds.
- **More AI-Based Enhancements** â€“ Integrate Stable Diffusion Inpainting to refine product blending using generative AI.
