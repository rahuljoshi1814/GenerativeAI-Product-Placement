## 📥 **Installation & Setup**
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GenerativeAI-Product-Placement.git
cd GenerativeAI-Product-Placement
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Download the Required AI Model
The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is required for segmentation.
Follow the instructions in models/README.md to download and place the model.
4️⃣ Download & Place the Dataset
Download product images from the provided link.
Follow the instructions in inputs/products/README.md.
🚀 Running the Project
Once everything is set up, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
✅ This will process all product images and save the final results in outputs/.

📂 Dataset Information
📌 Product Images: Download from inputs/products/README.md.
📌 Background Images: Stored in inputs/backgrounds/.
📌 AI Model Checkpoints: Download instructions in models/README.md.

🛠 Technologies Used
Python 🐍
OpenCV 📷
Segment Anything Model (SAM) 🧠
NumPy 🔢
TQDM (Progress Bar) 🚀
🔥 Possible Improvements
This project is functional, but there are several ways to enhance it further:

✅ Better Depth Matching – Use depth estimation models to match product depth with the background for even more realistic placement.
✅ Advanced Lighting Adjustments – Implement neural relighting to adjust product lighting according to background conditions.
✅ User-Specified Positioning – Allow users to manually adjust the placement of products inside backgrounds.
✅ More AI-Based Enhancements – Integrate Stable Diffusion Inpainting to refine product blending using generative AI.
